To-Do List Web App Project
===========================

Author: Muhammad Waqas  
Roll No: F2022266099  
Section: v4

Description:

This is a simple, responsive To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the browser's built-in `localStorage` to save tasks, so users can keep their tasks even after refreshing or closing the browser.


Features:
---------
✅ Add new tasks  
✅ Prevent adding empty or duplicate tasks  
✅ Mark tasks as completed  
✅ Delete individual tasks  
✅ Clear all tasks  
✅ Clear only completed tasks  
✅ Tasks saved in localStorage (persistent)  
✅ Responsive and user-friendly design  
✅ Keyboard support (press Enter to add task)

Technologies Used:
------------------
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with responsive design)  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- Web Storage API (localStorage)  

How to Use:
-----------
1. Open `index.html` to launch the landing page.
2. Click "Enter App" to go to the main To-Do List page (`todo.html`).
3. Start adding tasks using the input box and "Add" button (or press Enter).
4. Tasks are automatically saved to your browser (localStorage).
5. You can close the tab or browser — your tasks will still be there when you return.

Folder Structure:
-----------------
- index.html         → Welcome page  
- todo.html          → Main To-Do app  
- style.css          → Styling for both pages  
- script.js          → All JavaScript logic  
- images/            → Folder for task icons (checked/unchecked)  
- README.txt         → Project documentation  

Notes:
------
- No internet connection or database is needed.  
- This is a fully front-end project.  
- Make sure your browser allows localStorage (enabled by default).
